// There is a new component called ItemForm that will allow us to add new items to our shopping list. When the form is submitted, a new item should be created and added to our list of items.

// Make all the input fields for this form controlled inputs, so that you can access all the form data via state. When setting the initial state for the <select> tag, use an initial value of "Produce" (since that's the first option in the list).

// Handle the form's submit event, and use the data that you have saved in state to create a new item object with the following properties:

//   const newItem = {
//     id: uuid(), // the `uuid` library can be used to generate a unique id
//     name: itemName,
//     category: itemCategory,
//   };
// Add the new item to the list by updating state. To get the test passing, you'll need to use a prop called onItemFormSubmit as a callback and pass the new item to it.
// NOTE: to add a new element to an array in state, it's a good idea to use the spread operator:

//   function addElement(element) {
//     setArray([...array, element]);
//   }
// The spread operator allows us to copy all the old values of an array into a new array, and then add new elements as well. When you're working with state, it's important to pass a new array to the state setter function instead of mutating the original array.
